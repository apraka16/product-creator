PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of submission form

This is a placeholder for an actual screenshot image file.

When creating your own research materials, replace this with:
- An actual PNG or JPG screenshot
- Captured from timestamp [00:30 - 01:45] in the demo video

The screenshot should show:
- Main dashboard with "New Submission" button
- Submission form with auto-populated client information
- Business Owners Policy selection
- Pre-filled fields from AMS integration

Filename format: demo-screenshot-01-submission-form.png

For this example folder to work with the skill, you can add any sample screenshot image with this filename (without the .txt extension).
