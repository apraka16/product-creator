Example content for commercial submissions workflow:

CURRENT COMMERCIAL SUBMISSION WORKFLOW
======================================

Step 1: Initial Client Contact
- Client requests commercial insurance quote
- Agent gathers basic business information
- Agent determines coverage needs

Step 2: Data Collection
- Collect business details (revenue, employee count, locations)
- Request loss history (5 years)
- Gather specific risk information
- Request supporting documents (financial statements, safety programs, etc.)

Step 3: ACORD Form Completion
- Agent manually fills out ACORD 125 (Commercial Insurance Application)
- Complete ACORD 101 (Additional Remarks Schedule) if needed
- Fill out carrier-specific supplemental applications
- Time required: 2-3 hours per carrier

Step 4: Document Preparation
- Create statement of values spreadsheet
- Format loss runs per carrier requirements
- Compile additional questionnaires
- Organize all documents into submission packet

Step 5: Carrier Selection
- Call underwriters to check appetite
- Based on relationships and experience
- Typically submit to 2-4 carriers
- Manual process, no centralized information

Step 6: Submission Delivery
- Email submission packet to each carrier
- Or upload to individual carrier portals
- Each carrier has different format requirements
- Track submissions manually in spreadsheet

Step 7: Follow-up & Tracking
- Follow up via email or phone after 3-5 days
- Check on status, any questions
- Manually track in spreadsheet or email
- Wait for quotes (typically 5-10 business days)

Step 8: Quote Review & Presentation

- Compare coverage and pricing
- Present options to client
- Facilitate client decision

PAIN POINTS IDENTIFIED:
- Duplicate data entry across multiple carrier systems
- Time-consuming manual form completion
- Inconsistent document formatting
- Manual carrier appetite checking
- No centralized tracking system
- High potential for errors in transcription
