# Internal Research - Example Materials

This folder contains sample research materials to demonstrate proper file organization and naming conventions.

## Files in this example:

- `interview-agent-sample.txt` - Sample interview transcript with an insurance agent
- `demo-transcript-sample.txt` - Transcript from a product demo video
- `demo-screenshot-01-submission-form.png` - Screenshot showing submission form
- `demo-screenshot-02-carrier-list.png` - Screenshot showing carrier selection
- `workflow-sample.pdf` - Current workflow diagram

## How to use:

1. Test the internal-research skill on these sample files first
2. Study the naming conventions and organization
3. Create your own folder under `assets/your-product-name/`
4. Organize your materials following this pattern

**Note:** Do not modify or delete these examples - they serve as a reference template.
