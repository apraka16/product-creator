PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of carrier selection screen

This is a placeholder for an actual screenshot image file.

When creating your own research materials, replace this with:
- An actual PNG or JPG screenshot
- Captured from timestamp [03:20 - 05:00] in the demo video

The screenshot should show:
- Carrier selection interface
- List of carriers with appetite indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Real-time availability status
- Carrier A, Carrier B, Carrier C options

Filename format: demo-screenshot-02-carrier-list.png

For this example folder to work with the skill, you can add any sample screenshot image with this filename (without the .txt extension).
